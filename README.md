# mandelbrot
My mandelbrot function allows you to really zoom in the fractal which makes it much more interesting.
It works like this :
mandelbrot [int : degree of prescision] [float * float : coordinates x and y of the bottom left corner of the screen] [float : size (the smaller the size the bigger the zoom)]
